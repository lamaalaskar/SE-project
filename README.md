Dependencies:

Python 3
sqlite3 (built-in module)
Database Setup:

The system utilizes a SQLite database named user_data.db to store user accounts and their passwords. You can create this database manually or by running the provided script.

Code Structure:

The code consists of several Python functions:

create_account(username, password): Creates a new user account in the database.
login(username, password): Attempts to log in a user with the given credentials.
add_todo(username, todo): Adds a new to-do item to the user's list. (Note: This is a placeholder implementation.)
list_todos(username): Lists all to-do items for the user. (Note: This is a placeholder implementation.)
Additional Feature (To-Do List):

The provided add_todo and list_todos functions are simple placeholders. In a full implementation, you would need to choose a data storage mechanism (e.g., another table in the database, a separate file system) and implement the logic for adding, storing, and retrieving to-do items for each user.
